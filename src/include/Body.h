//! Joint describes the connection between BodyTree.
/*!
  All variables except strength needs to be explicitly set after creating a
  joint. connection_root is the position on the parent where to put the
  connection. connection_branch is the position on the child where to put
  the connection. hinge_orientation is the EulerZYX-angles of how the joint
  is oriented. When angles are 0,0,0; the orientation is along the x-axis and
  the rotation is around the z-axis. upper_limit is the max angle the rotation
  can have. This should be a positive float value not greater than 2*pi.
  lower_limit works the same as upper_limit but with negative values. strength
  is calculated implicitly from the masses of the connected BodyTrees i
  not explicitly set.

//! A BodyTree is the tree structure describing the body.
/*!
  Several BodyTrees can be connected in a tree structure to build the creatures
  body. Every BodyTree has a root Joint which describes how it is connected
  to its parent. The root of the tree (which is defined as the head of the
  creature) have this Joint as a dummy Joint since it is not connected to
  a parent BodyTree. box_dim describes the dimensions on the box. 0,0,0 is the
  center of the box and when a dimension is set, it grows in both directions.
  Therefore 1,1,1 will give a box with dimensions 2,2,2. density is the density
  in kg/m^3 of the box. friction is a parameter between 0.0 and 1.0. The tree
  structure is composed by the body_list of each BodyTree. This is a
  std::vector of all the children.
