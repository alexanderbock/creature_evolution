Simulation:
	contains:
		timer (counter of accumelated timesteps)
	

	does:
		virtual void Step(float dt) = 0;


VizSimulation : public Simulation:
	self collision is switchable
	Only handles updating of rigid bodies
	Does not construct BulletCreatures (Scene can construct BulletCreatures and add them to its VizSim)
		(BulletCreature can call UpdateMotors in Draw() during rendering)


EvoSimulation : public Simulation:

	contains:
		list of Creatures
		list of BulletCreatures

	does:
		no self collision
		constructs BulletCreatures from Creatures
		updates BulletCreature motors, collects performance data in Creature

		returns a full population
